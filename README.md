# Ants
Ant bot simulation

Rationale
This project is a study on how individual bots can form simple rules to interact and
create complex behaviour to acheive goals.

Here is a simulation of ants foraging for food to carry back to the nest.
Ants only have limited awareness of what is around them:
- scent trails for finding the nest
- scent trails for finding food

When enough food has been collected, the nest is able to produce an additional ant.
